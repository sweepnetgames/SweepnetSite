						<h2>Changes post game jam</h2>
						<p>First of all, I want to give a heartfelt thank you to everyone that took the time to give feedback during the FarmJam 2024. It means a lot that so many people were willing to try multiple times despite crashes and annoyances to give this game a fair shot. There were a lot of people that took a look at this game and I am very grateful. 
							I have removed the previous version of the game from the jam given that I got a ton of feedback and have a concrete direction to go in, and since there were some glaring issues I don't expect many folk to make it past them. 
							If you did not get a chance to rate the game, check back once the jam ends and you'll be able to play a more refined version. In the meantime please play someone else's game, there are a number without many ratings. 
							If you are eager to play, you can download this version at the bottom of this post.

						<h3>Now for the update:</h3>
						<p>I have spent quite awhile this past week on squashing bugs, adding UI optimizations for ease of use, and have made a few pieces of additional content. I tried to focus a lot on the quest and on crafting, 
							since that seemed to be a bottleneck for folks trying out the game.</p>
						<h4>First, bug fixes:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Fixed an issue where tile coloration didn't change when a water tile was expanded.</li>
							<li>Fixed some problems with the coyote fight</li>
							<li>Rebalanced combat pacing - attacks are much slower now.</li>
							<li>Fixed the issue where the inventory would get full and then stay locked full despite clearing room.</li>
							<li>Plants planted during the quest were not being saved, they are now.</li>
							<li>Items that were placed on the ground were not being saved (fence posts, etc.)</li>
							<li>Right click -> attack has been implemented</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Now for content that has been updated or adjusted:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Quest progress is now non-linear, meaning doing some tasks for the uncle then some for the cousin will not interrupt or affect the other.</li>
							<li>Right-clicking on items to craft in the crafting interfaces now shows the requirements</li>
							<li>Added icons for the inventory and equipment tabs</li>
							<li>Added a combat tab that allows you to choose whether the player auto-retaliates to attacks.</li>
							<li>Added projectiles, and a way to calculate ranged damage.</li>
							<li>Added numbers that show how much damage is taken and received. This number is after defensive calculations, so the number that has an affect on hp.</li>
							<li>Added a special defense, where if the equipped imbued bead are the same typing as the enemy attack, all damage will be mitigated. I will be making another post explaining how imbuing works at some point.</li>
						
						<span class="image featured"><img src="images/defense.gif" alt="" /></span>
						<li>Similarly, added a special attack that is either blocked by the opponent or the attack is enhanced.</li>
						<span class="image featured"><img src="images/attack.gif" alt="" /></span>
						</ul>
						<h4>Completely new additions:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>As you saw above, a new mayfly enemy. It shoots water and will be featured in the upcoming quest.</li>
						<span class="image featured"><img src="images/mayfly.gif" alt="" /></span>
						<li>Added a new tile type, traps! This will be useful for what I am planning for the upcoming quest and also for creating unique obstacles later on. The featured trap is a corrupted grass that an enemy will use to damage the player.</li>
						<span class="image featured"><img src="images/trap_tile.gif" alt="" /></span>
						<li>Added a grasshopper herbivore (not enemy) that can be imbued for another special attack.</li>
						<li>Added a quest journal that informs the player where they are in progressing the quest. I think this will be useful for orienting the player to what is next and reminding them if they took a break from the quest. </li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Next steps:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>As mentioned, I have some big plans for another quest. This quest will be a tutorial for the combat system and serve to help the player understand imbues and attack and defense typing. There will be a boss, and some neat rewards!</li>
							<li>I still have a long way to go in terms of helping the player understand how to use all of the tools and make it clearer what is actually possible in the game. I have some ideas for this but am also open to suggestions.</li>
							<li>I still need to make the player die, and create logic for player and enemy respawns.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Thanks for reading and I will see you next time!</h4>
