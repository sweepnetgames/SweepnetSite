						<h3>Background</h3>
						<p>I graduated in 2021 with a Master's degree in Ecology, and have since been working as a data analyst for research projects (honey bees, monarch butterflies, and Japanese beetles).
							My Master's thesis was on the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on monarch butterflies, so I am particularly interested in the effects of human interaction with conservation. 
							I have long been passionate about conservation and ecosystems and wanted to start this project as a way to visualize the complex interactions between living things.
							Over time, I hope to create a variety of fun games that convey ecological concepts in digestible ways.

								<h3>Food for crows</h3>
								<p>Food for crows is the first game I have worked on so far. I started by learning the Godot game engine and hit the ground running.
								Currently, the game features a variety of plants to grow, the ability to manipulate the environment, and a few short story lines. 
								Thus far, I have organized the way I create the game similar to how levels might present themselves in an ecosystem.
								The first step way to make the tile properties, and from there adding the plants was a complexity.
								Now, I am moving on to living things, herbivores, and after I have gotten a few implemented I will add carnivores.
								The top layer is human interaction with not only the environment,  but with each other and the world itself.
								This project was submitted for a game jam, so the exact order has not been as organized as I had initially planned, but progress is moving along quickly.</p>

								<h3>Next steps</h3>
								<p>I hope to gain interest in this project, and will see it through to completion.
								Once I am satisfied with this project, I will begin work on the next.
								What a wonderful hobby this is!</p>
